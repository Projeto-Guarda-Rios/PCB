    A FootprintLayoutNode is a node that draws the (main) layout of a footprint
    of a certain type. It is mainly used for devices which have "common"
    layouts, but can be used for any footprint. The main use is allowing many
    generators to share the geometry of the footprint, but drive them with
    different parameters as they need.

    They are usually driven in fairly generic terms (e.g. device 2x3mm, 4pins,
    pitch) etc, and detailed metadata is appended to the parent FP as siblings
    to this node.  In particular, layouts do not care what kind of device it is,
    they only care about the geometry of the footprint (so they are a graphical
    abstraction).

    If geometry needs to be derived from a complex calculation such as IPC
    formulae using various input parameters, it may be better to add a factory
    fuction that does this. For example, instead of the layout node taking "pin
    size" and "global config", the factory function distills it into "pad size"
    and "drill size", and the layout node doesn't need to know about IPC rules,
    it just takes pure geometry. The means it can be driven directly if needed,
    or by another factory function.

    On the other hand, driving silk/fab/courtyard line properties with global
    config is probably a good idea, as it saves a lot of repetition.

    This is distinct from Footprint, which is also a Node, but represents the
    entire footprint, including all other nodes and metadata.

    E.g.:

    - Footprint
       - FootprintLayoutNode (some subclass of)
          - Pad (created by the layout)
          - Line ....
          - Text
       - Model
       - Additional drawings
