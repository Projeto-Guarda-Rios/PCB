        Points are easy, because they can't be rotated, and a flip is just a matter of
        negating the x or y coordinate.

        But it won't work for things like rectangles when they are rotated by a non-90
        degree angle.

        It also won't cover things like rotating polygons while keeping them upright,
        but that requires quite some thought, as the result you get depends on what you
        call the "origin" of the polygon. And probably isn't really useful.

class AdditionalDrawing(ABC):
    """Additional drawings are free-form drawings that can be added to the footprint in
    addition to the main shape. They can be used to add unique features to the footprint
    that are not covered by a main generator.

    Example:
        For example, adding circle to denote a pressure port or similar:

        .. code-block::

            additional_drawing:
                inner_circle:
                    type: circle

                    width: 0.1

                    inherit: key1
                    radius: 2

    Inheritance is possible between additional drawings (this is why they are keyed by name).

    Complex shapes can be implemented as their own drawing types, or, perhaps, as a
    full-blown declarative definition class.

    This class could is agnostic to whether it's in a footprint or symbol or something
    else.
