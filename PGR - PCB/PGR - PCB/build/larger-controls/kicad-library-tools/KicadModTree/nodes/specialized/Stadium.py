        Sometimes called a racetrack shape, or oblong (that's also the name of a
        non-square rectangle), or obround, or oval. Stadium is about the only
        unambiguous name for this shape!

        Args:
            layer: Layer.
            width: Line width in mm.
            style: Line style.
            fill: `True` if the stadium is filled, `False` if only the outline is
                visible.
            offset: Amount by which the stadium is inflated or deflated (if offset is
                negative).
            shape: Shape from which to derive the parameters of the stadium. When a
                `GeomRectangle` is passed, then the stadium is inscribed in that
                rectangle.
            center_1: Coordinates (in mm) of the center of the first semi-circle.
            center_2: Coordinates (in mm) of the center of the second semi-circle.
            radius: The radius of the semi-circles in mm.

        Example:
            The following 3 stadiums are identical:

            >>> stadium1 = Stadium(center_1=(-1, 0), center_2=(+1, 0), radius = 1.0)
